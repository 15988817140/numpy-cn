# The NumPy community

The community of NumPy users and developers is large and decentraliazed. We try to direct certain conversations to certain channels.

1. Use the #numpy tag on StackOverflow for usage questions (like “How do I do X in NumPy?”).
1. Use the GitHub issue tracker for
  - Bug reports (like “np.arange(3).shape returns (5,), when it should return (3,).”)
  - Documentation issues (like “I found this section unclear”)
  - Feature requests (like “I would like to have a new interpolation method in np.percentile.”)
1. Use the NumPy mailing list for longer-form discussion items. This is for things that concern the broader NumPy community. Most users probably don’t care about an obscure edge-case in np.polynomial.Legendre (which should be reported on the issue tracker), but may care about larger-picture things like
  - How should we have discussions about NumPy and the community?
  - Developing or adding items to a NumPy roadmap
  - Announcing sprints or conference talks
  - Changes to the development workflow
  - Announcements for NumPy releases and developer meetings
  - …
