# 常用API

In this chapter routine docstrings are presented, grouped by functionality. Many docstrings contain example code, which demonstrates basic usage of the routine. The examples assume that NumPy is imported with:

```pyhton
>>> import numpy as np
```

A convenient way to execute examples is the ``%doctest_mode`` mode of IPython, which allows for pasting of multi-line examples and preserves indentation.
